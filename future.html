                <p>
                    Robotics is a new, ever changing, technology. We are always
                    looking for new ideas that will help us grow delicious, fresh produce.

                            Drones are becoming more readily available for commercial use.
                            We have plans to implement flying drones in a number of roles.
                            to help around the farm, depending on the size of the drone.
                            By using camera drones in conjunction with A.I we soon will be able to
                            analyse fields and monitor crop development. With even larger craft
                            we believe that we will be able to plant and even spray crops.

                            As Robotics gets more advanced, we can start to implement them
                            in our fields in more roles. So far we have seen how Robots can 
                            be used in out fields, but with some limitations. Soon we believe that we
                            will be able to have fully autonomous farms, where the robots
                            will charge, clean and maintain themselves. Advanced A.I will also be 
                            able to recognise ripe and fully grown crops, then pick them. With better 
                            robots, the produced will be carefully picked, as to not spoil the crops.

                            With the mass amounts of data each robot will be collecting
                            you will be able to know what is happening with the farm in all aspects.
                            We hope to collect all this data and make it as readable as possible, 
                            even from the comfort of your own home while you can take it easy

                            With technology advancing at such a rate, we are excited for what amazing breakthrough
                            will be next. 20 years ago, the use of drones and other robotics in farming was a distant 
                            dream. But now robots are able to pick fruit, grow crops and can be an essential piece of 
                            equipment on all farms. We will continue to advocate for the use of robotics on farms, to grow a 
                            greener future.
